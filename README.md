# Purpose
This project is a response to the [AI Engineering Bootcamp challenge](https://aimakerspace.io/aie-challenge/). It is an application written in python that uses:
- python: chainlit, openai
- Docker

The instructions are not clear whether it is necessary that the app be a web app, so the final product may use FastAPI (or not).
